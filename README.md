# Dynamical Tilt Maze Solving with 4 6DoF Franka Robots Using SARSA with Eligibility Trace

## CS449/549 Learning For Robotics Final Project

If you are interested in the project, you can contact me via my email, bora.tuncer@ug.bilkent.edu.tr

## Description
This project focuses on working the four robotic arms in harmony to tilt the maze throughout the path of the ball with
precise movement. Our methodology involved experimenting with six different dynamical tilting mazes with the SARSA algorithm
with eligibility traces. We expect our findings to enhance the real-world applications of RL with the time efficiency of our software
experiments.

## Quick Start

You can run the model by running the test.py or try it on your own by running the manuel_test.py.
